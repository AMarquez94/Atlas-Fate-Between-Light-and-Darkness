## "Merge with the shadows"

In this game, you take control of a stealth expert with the ability to merge with the shadows. This power allows him to move without being seen, climb walls, cushion falls or pass through obstacles.

The game is set in a futuristic world, where overpopulation has reached unsustainable levels. This is causing the energy to start running out. Only Atlas, the powerful energy megacorporation, has succeeded on providing the necessary power in order to maintain a stable situation.

But Atlas has lost control over the security system one of their power plants, located in a mysterious planet. Guarded by robots, they can't reenter there, so they hire you to do the mission: reactivate the core of the power plant.

This game has been developed in 2017 for the Video Game Creation Master of Pompeu Fabra University and has been made using a custom engine programmed from scratch.
