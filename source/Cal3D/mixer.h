/** 
 * CalAbstractMixer defines the API that CalModel relies on for
 * blending and scheduling animations. A third party mixer must
 * implement this API in order to register itself with the
 * CalModel::setAbstractMixer method. The default mixer (CalMixer) is
 * an example of such implementation.
 *
 * cal3d expects a mixer to handle two tasks : scheduling and
 * blending. Scheduling refers to everything related to time such
 * as when an animation must run or when it must stop. Blending
 * defines how concurrent animations influence each other: for 
 * instance walking and waving.
 *
 * If CalMixer proves to be insufficient for the applications needs,
 * an alternate mixer can be implemented and used without notifying
 * cal3d in any way. It is not mandatory to subclass
 * CalAbstractMixer. However, when chosing this path, one must also
 * avoid using the CalModel::update method because it would use the
 * default mixer instantiated by the CalModel::create method with
 * undesirable side effects. In addition libraries based on cal3d
 * (think NebulaDevice or OpenSceneGraph adapters) are not aware of
 * these constraints and will keep calling the CalModel::update method of
 * CalModel regardless.
 *
 * Subclassing CalAbstractMixer when implementing an alternate mixer
 * therefore provides a better integration with cal3d and libraries
 * that rely on CalModel. However, an additional effort is required in
 * order to achieve compatibility with libraries or applications that
 * rely on the CalMixer API (i.e. that use methods such as blendCycle
 * or executeAction).  The CalMixer API is not meant to be generic and
 * there is no reason to define an abstract class that specifies
 * it. For historical reasons and because CalMixer is the default
 * mixer, some applications and libraries (think Soya or CrystalSpace)
 * depend on it. If they want to switch to a scheduler with extended
 * capabilities it might be painfull for them to learn a completely
 * different API. A scheduler with the ambition to obsolete CalMixer
 * should therefore provide an API compatible with it to ease the
 * migration process.
 *
 * Short summary, if you want to write a new mixer:
 *
 * 1) An external mixer: ignore CalAbstractMixer and implement a mixer
 * of your own. Avoid calling CalModel::update and any library or
 * application that will call it behind your back. Avoid libraries and
 * applications that rely on the default mixer CalMixer, as returned
 * by CalModel::getMixer.
 *
 * 2) A mixer registered in cal3d : subclass CalAbstractMixer,
 * register it with CalModel::setAbstractMixer.  Avoid libraries and
 * applications that rely on the default mixer CalMixer, as returned
 * by CalModel::getMixer. CalModel::getMixer will return a null
 * pointer if CalModel::setAbstractMixer was called to set
 * a mixer that is not an instance of CalMixer.
 *
 * 3) A CalMixer replacement : same as 2) and provide a subclass of
 * your own mixer that implements the CalMixer API so that existing
 * applications can switch to it by calling CalModel::getAbstractMixer
 * instead of CalModel::getMixer. The existing code using the CalMixer
 * methods will keep working and the developper will be able to 
 * switch to a new API when convenient.
